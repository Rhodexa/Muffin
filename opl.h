  There's 236 register we actually care about.
  In theory, we could essentially update the entirety of the register set
  at about 800Hz...this is good news, because it means at the very least
  we have plenty of time to update the buffers

  The 236 registers are:
    18 channels running on 3 registers each (+54)
    36 operators running on 5 registers each (+180)
    0x104 (Connection Select)
    0x0BD (Tremolo and Vibrato depth) â€” this also includes rhythms but... yeah, we don't use that  

  // two-digit register names are mirrored in the second half of the chip at A1 = 1
