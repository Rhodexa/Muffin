/*
  this lib will contain the necessary information to:
  Handle all the data that means an "instrument" which is how the voice should sound, and that includes every single parameter that's part of the synth.
  And also handle "file" logic, that is, to allow an external SPI/I2C flash or eeprom to hold these instruments indefinetively if the user wants to.
